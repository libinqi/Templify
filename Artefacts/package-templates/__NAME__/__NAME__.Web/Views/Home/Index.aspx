    <h2>Northwind MVC Example Pages</h2>
    <h3><i>Very</i> Simple Category Listing and Details</h3>
    <p>
        Three pages have been included for viewing: list, detail and create.
        <ul>
            <li>
                <%= Html.ActionLink((CategoriesController c) => c.Index(), "List Categories") %>: 
                Using a master page, this page simply lists out all the categories in the database.  
                This uses an "out of the box" repository to retrieve the categories from the database.  
                To view the category details, click a category name on the listing page.
            </li>
            <li>
                Create Category:  To create a category, use the following URL, replacing the 
                category name paramater's value with anything you'd like:  
                <%= Html.BuildUrlFromExpression<CategoriesController>(c => c.Create("Your_Category_Name")) %>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <h3>Very Simple Customers Listing with Lazy Loading</h3>
    <p>
        Likewise for cutomer data, three pages have been included for viewing: list, detail and create.
        <ul>
            <li>
                <%= Html.ActionLink((CustomersController c) => c.Index(), "List Customers")%>: 
                Not using a master page, this page lists the customers in the database who are from Venezuela.  
                Since this uses a custom data-access method, this demonstrates extending the 
                base repository with a custom retrieval method.  As it lists the number of orders that each 
                customer has placed, it's also an example of lazy-loaded collections.
            </li>
            <li>
                Create Customer:  To create a customer, use the following URL, replacing the 
                company name and customer's assigned ID with anything you'd like; 
                but note that the assigned ID must be exactly 5 characters:  
                <%= Html.BuildUrlFromExpression<CustomersController>(c => c.Create("Some_Company_Name", "A_5_Character_Unique_ID")) %>.  
                This is an example of creating an object with an assigned ID.  Using <i>assigned IDs should typically be 
                considered a bad practice</i> and should be avoided unless you're having to 
                integrate with a legacy application.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <h3>CRUD of Employees with Validation using NHibernate.Validator</h3>
    <p>
        These pages represent full CRUD functionality of Employee objects.  If you're just starting 
        with ASP.NET MVC and/or NHibernate, you may want to take a look at the other sections below 
        for something a bit simpler.
        <ul>
            <li>
                <!-- We cannot use Html.ActionLink to link to a controller within an area -->
                <%= Html.ActionLink("List Employees", "Index", "Employees", new{ area="Organization"}, null) %>
                This page lists all of the employees in the database, provides a means to edit 
                an existing one, and also a form to create a brand new one.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <h3>Dashboard Controller using an 'Application Service'</h3>
    <p>
        An application services layer exists to hold...well...application services.  The idea is to move logic
        which may leak into a controller into application services to manage the coordination acitivities.  This 
        is the <a href="http://martinfowler.com/eaaCatalog/serviceLayer.html">service layer described by Martin Fowler</a>.
        An example page, which is fed by a controller which uses an application service, may be found 
        <%= Html.ActionLink((DashboardController c) => c.Index(), "here") %>. All of this is fully unit 
        tested in the Northwind.Tests project to demonstrate how it can be tested, accordingly.
    </p>
    <%--<h3>Territories Pulled via WCF</h3>
    <p>
        This page shows the territories from the database, pulled via a WCF service.  
        For this to work, you must <span style="font-weight:bold">set up an IIS virtual directory called 
        NorthwindWcfServices which points to &lt;unzip location>\src\NorthwindSample\app\Northwind.Wcf.Web</span>. 
        After you've done that bit of setup, you can 
        <%= Html.ActionLink("Territories Pulled via WCF", "Index", "Territories", new { area = "" }, null)%> to see it in action. 
    </p>--%>
    <h3>Unit Tests</h3>
    <p>
        There are many more examples of functionality, including data access unit tests, found in the 
        Northwind.Tests project.  I encourage you to take a look.  There are also a number of unit tests
        within SharpArch.Tests; particularly for reviewing the Equals/GetHashCode functionality and the 
        use of DomainSignatureComparable and Entity base classes.
